Once upon a time, there lived a curmugeonly character known as Poor Henry Pritchard. Poor Henry Pritchard was so poor because he only talked to servers, and while they were quite interesting he always wanted to talk to clients too. All Poor Henry's friends like John Script, Ruby and Reginald Rails, and a large Indoneisan known simply for their island of origin, Java, were getting much more attention than Poor Henry. Determined to regain his popularity Poor Henry set off on a quest to find the Book of Many Faces and share it with the people! 


Poor Henry Pritchard knew this was not going to be an easy quest. The Book of Many Faces haven't been seen for many years by no one in
Programhill. Poor Henry knew he would need some help, so the first thing he did was an algolist -  which was going to help
him to organized things he needed to accomplish before his journey begins. The first three things on the algolist were: Find brave friends, SQL(some quality lunch), and defensive weapons. 

Poor Henry went down to his local pub, The Footer, to find some companions for his journey. Luckily, his good friend and partner in crime Colonel Severus Snape was there with his magic stylus. Sitting with the Colonel was Harold T.M. Lightfoot, a fellow they met in the early 1990's. Lastly, they grabbed DJ JazzyScript, who really  was just there to make them look cool. The crew was assembled. Now, it was time to begin their journey to defeat Roger Buggington and all his heirs.

At first light the crew set off towards Roger's castle in the Valley of Silicon. Meanwhile, at Roger's castle, Roger and his heirs were also preparing for a journey. Poor Henry and his crew approached from the North just as Roger and his heirs had hoped. The battle would play out in the open field. Suddenly, a flash of light and a loud crack stopped everyone in their tracks. Slowly decending from the sky was a mysterious figure cloaked in blue. The figure landed directly between the two crews and commanded they stop the fight.
"We haven't even started fighting!" complained Roger.
