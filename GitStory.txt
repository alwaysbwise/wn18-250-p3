Once upon a time, there lived a curmugeonly character known as Poor Henry Pritchard. Poor Henry Pritchard was so poor because he only talked to servers, and while they were quite interesting he always wanted to talk to clients too. All Poor Henry's friends like John Script, Ruby and Reginald Rails, and a large Indoneisan known simply for their island of origin, Java, were getting much more attention than Poor Henry. Determined to regain his popularity Poor Henry set off on a quest to find the Book of Many Faces and share it with the people! 


Poor Henry Pritchard knew this was not going to be an easy quest. The Book of Many Faces haven't been seen for many years by no one in
Programhill. Poor Henry knew he would need some help, so the first thing he did was an algolist -  which was going to help
him to organized things he needed to accomplish before his journey begins. The first three things on the algolist were: Find brave friends, 
SQL(some quality lunch), and defensive weapons.
