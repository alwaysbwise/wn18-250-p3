Poor Henry went down to his local pub, The Footer, to find some companions for his journey. Luckily, his good friend and partner in crime Colonel Severus Snape was there with his magic stylus. Sitting with the Colonel was Harold T.M. Lightfoot, a fellow they met in the early 1990's. Lastly, they grabbed DJ JazzyScript, who really  was just there to make them look cool. The crew was assembled. Now, it was time to begin their journey to defeat Roger Buggington and all his heirs.
